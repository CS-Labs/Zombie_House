Authors: John Clark, Christian Seely, Duong Nguyen
Entry Point: House.java

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: 
The jar file must be run as it is in the zip file. It just needs to be contained in a folder with the other folders in the .zip file. We tried but were unable to get it to run separately.

As the game loads, as well as between levels, at death, and at the end of the game, you will be presented with status screens that are 
clickable to proceed. 

Controls:
WASD: Player movement
Mouse: Look around
Mouse Click: proceed at game screens
Shift: Run
Space: Pause

Bugs/Unfinished:
-Player sometimes gets stuck in a wall. Holding shift and shaking the mouse tends to fix it.
-Zombie spawn rate was cut in half due to out of memory errors.
-Zombie on zombie collision is turned off due to pathfinding.
-Zombies sometimes cut through corners when pathfinding.

Guide for how to dynamically change the sound levels of audio clips while they are playing was found in the book Java Examples in a Nutshell by David Flanagan.
Note: this guide was used to aid in the integration of the ability to dynamically change the decibel levels of the sound channels to implement directional sound effects.
